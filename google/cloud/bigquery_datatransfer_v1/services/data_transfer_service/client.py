        Some data sources doesn't support service account, so we
        need to talk to them on behalf of the end user. This API
        just checks whether we have OAuth token for the
        particular user, which is a pre-requisite before user
        can create a transfer config.

            request (:class:`~.datatransfer.CheckValidCredsRequest`):
                The request object. A request to determine whether the
                user has valid credentials. This method is used to limit
                the number of OAuth popups in the user interface. The
                user id is inferred from the API call context.
                If the data source has the Google+ authorization type,
                this method returns false, as it cannot be determined
                whether the credentials are already valid merely based
                on the user id.
            name (:class:`str`):
                Required. The data source in the form:
                ``projects/{project_id}/dataSources/{data_source_id}``
                or
                ``projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/dataSources/{data_source_id}``.
                This corresponds to the ``name`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.

            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:
            ~.datatransfer.CheckValidCredsResponse:
                A response indicating whether the
                credentials exist and are valid.
